description: Identity and coding guidelines
---

Welcome to the J++ Style Guide!

This document has two purposes: to present the **identity design system** for the J++ brand, and to outline the **coding best practices** employed for J++ projects. 

_[Explain what J++ is]_

_[Introduce the design system]_

_[Explain why coding guidelines are like a design system]_

_[Detail the target audience: Internal network, but also people interested in the workings of an agency like ours.]_

## Design System Benefits
Explain how the design system benefits users and the business. For inspiration, check out over 180 examples of design systems at [Styleguides.io](http://styleguides.io/examples).

## Contributing info
If it's desirable to have people from across the organization contribute to the design system, linking to the <a href="{{ "/contributing.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">contributing page</a> from the homepage could be a good idea.
